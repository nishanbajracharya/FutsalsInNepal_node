# FutsalsInNepal

A listing of Futsal centers in Nepal

## How to get started

Before you can see the site in action, you need to setup a few things first. 

1. Being a nodejs project, this requires node installed in your computer. With that done, let's move on.
2. You need to install dependencies first, so open a terminal in the project directory and run the following command `npm install`. The dependencies are listed in the package.json file.
3. This project uses mongoDB as the database, so have that installed too. Make sure the mongo server is running, i.e. mongod should be running.

## Running the project

Now that the setup is done, let's run the project. In your project directory, open a terminal and run the command `npm start`. That's it. The server is running and is listening for connections at port 2000.
So open your browser and run `http://localhost:2000` or `http://127.0.0.1:2000`.
