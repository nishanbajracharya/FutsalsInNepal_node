## How to get started

Before you can see the site in action, you need to setup a few things first. 

1. Being a nodejs project, this requires node installed in your computer.
2. You need to install dependencies first, so open a terminal in the project directory and run the following command `npm install`.
3. This project used mongoDB as the database, so have that installed. Make sure the mongo server is running, ie mongod should be running.

## Running the porject

Now that the setup is done, let's run the project. In your project directory, open a terminal and run the command `npm start`. That's it. The server is running and is listening for connections at port 2000.
So open your browser and run `http://localhost:2000` or `http://127.0.0.1:2000`.
